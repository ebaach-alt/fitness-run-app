# Feature Specification: Fitness Run App

## Overview
Fitness Run App is an **offline-first** open-source running tracking application designed to work seamlessly without internet connectivity. The app prioritizes local data storage, offline GPS tracking, and provides synchronization capabilities when connectivity is available.

## Core Philosophy: Offline-First Design

The app is built on the principle that **all core functionality must work without an internet connection**. This ensures:
- Reliable tracking in remote areas without cellular coverage
- No dependency on cloud services for basic functionality
- Privacy-focused data storage on user's device
- Reduced data usage and battery consumption
- Consistent user experience regardless of connectivity

## Conclusion

Fitness Run App is designed to be a reliable, privacy-focused, and fully functional running tracker that works anywhere, anytime—**with or without internet connectivity**. By prioritizing offline functionality, we ensure that runners can track their activities in remote locations, maintain their privacy, and have complete control over their data.

The offline-first architecture ensures that the app is not just a cloud service client, but a complete, standalone application that enhances the running experience without dependencies on external services.
